# Human-Activity-Classification
Classic classification to determine human activity based on data derived by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), according to the EvAAL competition technical annex.

Steps taken:
- Cleansing the data by removing records with NaN's
- Removing irrelevant attributes that did not contribute in model
- Scaled the data using min-max scaling process
- Used Python “sklearn” library to implement data models
- Models implemented:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis
    - K – Neighbors
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machines
